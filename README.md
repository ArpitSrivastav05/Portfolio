This is my first Web Development Basic Project which includes basic HTML,CSS and Javascript.

The First Task which I made is a portfolio which includes:- Header Section - which includes name and logo at the top, About Section, Skill Section, Project Section, Resume section and Contact Section.
At last a footer which includes a copyright notice.

Second Task is the Landing Page of a company which includes lots of css elements such as padding, colour palette, and other elements. I have also added the animation in the page to look more creative.

Third Task is to create a basic calculator using CSS, HTML and JavaScript. An Interactive interface with multiple basic operations. This includes CSS grid system for button allignments.

Thank you...!!
